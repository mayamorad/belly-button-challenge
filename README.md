# belly-button-challenge

**Background**

This project involves building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs microbes found in human navels. The dataset highlights that while a few microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) are commonly found in over 70% of people, most species are relatively rare.

**Files Included:**
- index.html: Main HTML file for the dashboard.
- samples.json: Provided reference dataset (not accessed locally).
- static/: Contains supporting JavaScript and CSS files.

**Instructions:**
  1. Data Retrieval: Use the D3 library to fetch data from:https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json
  2. Bar Chart: Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown to display the top 10 OTUs per individual.
